The Tic-Tac-Toe application is a classic game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid, taking
turns to place their respective symbols (X or O) until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. 
This project is an excellent way to practice front-end web development skills, especially in handling user interactions and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) with JavaScript.


Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the application.
CSS: Used for styling the application and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Implements the core functionality of the game, including game logic and DOM manipulation.
